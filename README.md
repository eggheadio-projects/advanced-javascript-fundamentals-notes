It all starts with syntax. From there, once you’ve got the concepts down, you can move into using a framework where you figure out how to make things “just work”.

Everything is great, until it’s not.

If someone put you on the spot right now and asked you to explain this, would they like your answer?

What about prototypal inheritance or coercion?

In this workshop, you’ll be taking things to the next level, shining a light into “black-box” concepts like prototypes, the this keyword, and what primitive types are.

Tyler will walk you through each concept, and build your understanding through examples in the areas you need to know.
